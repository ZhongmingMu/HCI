Proj 6 Requirement:

1. Horizontal Prototype
  At the top level, prototype should include every feature needed for three of your tasks. In other words, when you open your application, the user should see all of the options available for the three tasks.

2. Vertcical Prototype
   shallow for most features, but deep in one feature. Leave out most of your implementation. Where system responses are needed, make them canned (i.e., always the same) or random. But implement your chosen feature deeply and thoroughly. 

3. High fidelity in look
